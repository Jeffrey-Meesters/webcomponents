# Webcomponents

My first tryout with Webcomponents by using Lit.
I used open-wc documentation to manually set up a simpel project to expirement with this tech.

## Tech

- [open-wc](https://open-wc.org/docs/building/rollup/#manual-setup)
- [lit](https://lit.dev/)
- [webcomponents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components)
- [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/)
- [es-dev-server](https://github.com/open-wc/es-dev-server)

## Install

Clone this repo to your computer.
Run `cd webcomponents && npm i`

#### run the application

In your terminal:

1. First make a build
   `npm run build`
   This will watch any changes on the project
2. Now serve the application via the dev server in another terminal window
   `npm start`

## Development

When the project is installed and you've started the application you should now be able to create webcomponents and import them in the index.html. When any change is made your browser should automatically reload and changes should be visible.
